          <h1> Code of Conduct </h1>
          <p> Our mission is to reduce crime in neighborhoods. By sharing videos of suspicious or criminal activity with our neighbors, we can all work together to make our communities safer for all. </p>

          <p>With Ring Neighborhoods, we want to foster an inclusive online community where all our neighbors feel welcomed and respected, and where they can share important and sometimes sensitive information with each other. To ensure that Ring Neighborhoods remains a platform for neighbors to respectfully interact with each other, we’ve created the following Community Guidelines. </p>

          <p> Ring Neighborhoods depends on neighbors like you to ensure that our community treats each other with respect and civility. If you identify anything that violates our Community Guidelines, please flag the post and bring it to our attention. Keep in mind, however, that our Neighborhoods are filled with people with diverse beliefs, so just because you disagree with a neighbor, it doesn’t mean they violated our Community Guidelines. </p>
