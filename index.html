          <h1> Mission Statement </h1>
          <p>
            At Ring, our mission is to reduce crime in neighborhoods. Ring Neighborhoods expands the Ring of Security from your front door to your neighborhood by letting you easily share and communicate with your neighbors about crime and safety and providing you with up-to-date local crime data. We believe that knowledge and communication fosters stronger and safer communities. Together, we can make our neighborhoods better places to live for our families, friends and neighbors.
          </p>

          <h1> Community Guidelines </h1>

          <p>
            We ultimately depend on neighbors like you to uphold our standards. If you identify anything that violates our Community Guidelines, please flag the post and bring it to our attention. We ask that you keep in mind that [Ring Neighborhoods] has a large and diverse user base that will have differing points of view, some of which you may find objectionable. While we will do our best to ensure compliance with our Community Guidelines, we respect free speech and multiple points of view and do not seek to advance any agenda beyond neighborhood safety.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you violate our Community Guidelines or the spirit in which they are intended, we may remove the offending content or terminate your account. Ring will work with law enforcement in any case where we believe that there is a risk of harm to our neighbors or public safety.
          </p>

            <h2> Crime and Safety Related <br class="iphone5-break">Content Only</h2>
            <p>
              Ring Neighborhoods is a place to share, discuss and raise awareness about crime and safety-related activity in your community. Content that is not related to crime and safety in your neighborhood should not be posted and will be removed immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before you post any content about particular individuals, consider the behavior that made you suspicious and whether such suspicion is reasonable. Also, in describing any individuals, focus on providing a sufficient amount relevant details to distinguish such individual from others. For example, whereas reports of a white woman stealing a package are not particularly useful, reports of a young white woman with long black hair, wearing a black tank top, blue jeans, and a black cap may help identify the suspect.
